# Python Requirements (if needed for any scripts)
# Currently not required - all scripts are bash

# Future enhancements could include:
# - Python automation scripts
# - AWS SDK (boto3) for advanced operations
# - Kubernetes Python client

# For now, this file serves as a placeholder
# All dependencies are installed via package managers:
# - apt (Ubuntu packages)
# - Terraform (infrastructure)
# - Helm (Kubernetes package manager)
# - kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)
